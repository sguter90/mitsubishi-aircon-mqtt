# Solder Arduino Pin Headers

If you never soldered before then I can recommend this YouTube video: [10 Soldering Tips to Instantly Improve Your Soldering Skills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTYDSCUUDSQ)

I've also watched this video about how to solder ATMega328P pin headers: [How To - Solder Pin Headers to an Arduino Pro Mini](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37mW1i_oEpA)

If you never soldered before then you can start by soldering two cables.
Especially using a 0,35mm thin solder is tricky at first.

I've mounted the pin headers like in the video above.
